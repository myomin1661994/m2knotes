Grap theory

Grap theroy is study of the properties and application
of graphs


node to represent -> article 
edge is represent -> relationship

Type of Graphs

 Undirected Graph is sample count 
for example  node is city and edgs is city
and count the path
(u, v) -> (v, u)

Directed Graph (Digraph)

only can go (u, v)
for example give the gift to other and receive the 
gift from other
  
Weighted Graphs

 edges  on the graph contain the arbitrary value(1, 2, 3)
with represent an cost, distance, quantity, etc

->(u, v, w) -the grap know where the come form and where the go
whether the graph is directed or undirected

Specail Graphs
	=> Tree
		Tree is an undirected graph with no cycle
		Equivalently, n and n-1

	=>Rooted Tree
		tree with designated root node
		edge are points away from or toward the root node
		edge are away from the root -> arborescence (out tree) 
		edge are forwar to the root - > anit arborescence(int tree)
	=> Directed Acycli Graphs(DAGS)
		direct graph with no cycle
		dependencies structure
		all are out tree but not all are out tree

	=> Bipartite Graph
		splite into two group, every edge is connect to the two group(u, v)
		
	=>Complete Graphs
		unique edge between every pair of nodes
		complete n verticese Kn
		Testing algorithm
